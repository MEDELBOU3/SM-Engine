## 🌟 Core Features

SM-Engine provides a robust set of tools for 3D creation and simulation:

*   **🎨 Brush Modeling Suite:**
    *   Intuitive tools for direct mesh manipulation (e.g., Draw, Smooth, Flatten - *if applicable, list specific tools*).
    *   Adjustable brush parameters like `Size` and `Density` for fine control.
    *   Directly upload reference models or base meshes.
    *   Seamlessly import models using the integrated file browser.

*   **🔗 Visual Node Editor:**
    *   Design complex materials, shaders, procedural geometry, or game logic visually.
    *   Connect nodes to create intricate relationships and data flows.
    *   Highly extensible for adding custom node types.

*   **⚙️ Integrated Physics Engine:**
    *   Multiple distinct environments for physics simulation setup.
    *   Simulate rigid body dynamics, collisions, gravity, and potentially other forces (*specify if known, e.g., constraints, joints*).
    *   Ideal for testing game mechanics or visualizing physical interactions.

*   **🖼️ Advanced Viewport:**
    *   High-fidelity rendering powered by OpenGL 4.0+.
    *   Multiple camera modes including Orthographic presets (Top, Front, Side) and Perspective view.
    *   Real-time performance monitoring (FPS, Object Count) directly in the UI.
    *   Standard transformation gizmos for object manipulation (Translate, Rotate, Scale - *if applicable*).

*   **📂 Robust Workflow & I/O:**
    *   Standard `Undo`/`Redo` functionality for non-destructive editing.
    *   Hierarchical scene organization panel.
    *   Dedicated `Assets` management panel (*clarify if it's for browsing files, managing internal assets, or both*).
    *   Import support for common 3D formats: `.obj`, `.fbx`, `.stl`.
    *   Export capabilities for sharing or further processing (*specify export formats, e.g., `.obj`, scene format*).
    *   Session `Recording` system with time tracking, useful for tutorials or analysis.

## 📐 Interface Overview

The editor employs a modular, panel-based layout designed for flexibility:


+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| Main Toolbar (File, Edit, Assets, Export, View, Help...)    |
+--------------------------+------------------------------------+
| Hierarchy / Scene        |                                    |
|   - Physics Environments |         3D Viewport                |
|   - Objects              |         (Main Work Area)           |
|   - Cameras (Ortho/Persp)|                                    |
|   - Node Graphs          |                                    |
+--------------------------+------------------------------------+
| Assets Panel /           | Inspector / Properties Panel       |
| Brush Settings /         |   - Object Transform               |
| Node Editor              |   - Component Details (Physics,    |
| (Context Dependent)      |     Materials, Scripts...)         |
|                          |   - Brush Parameters               |
+--------------------------+------------------------------------+
| Status Bar / Output (FPS, Object Count, Recording Status)     |

Top: Main Menu & Toolbar for global actions.

Left: Hierarchy, Scene Organization, and context-specific panels like Brush Settings.

Center: The primary 3D Viewport for interaction and visualization.

Right: Inspector panel displaying properties of the selected object or tool.

Bottom: Status bar for real-time feedback and output logs.

🚀 Quick Start Guide
Get up and running with the editor in a few steps:

Launch: Run the editor executable (see Installation section).

New Project: Go to File > New to start a fresh scene.

Add Elements:

Use the Hierarchy panel to add a Physics Environment.

Import models (.obj, .fbx, .stl) via the Brush Settings panel or File > Import.

Alternatively, use the Brush Tools to sculpt directly onto a base primitive or imported mesh.

Manipulate: Select objects in the Hierarchy or Viewport and use the Inspector to modify their transform, materials, or physics properties. Use viewport gizmos if available.

Simulate: If a physics environment is set up, you might need to press a 'Play' button (if available) to start the simulation.

Navigate: Use the camera presets (Orthographic buttons) or standard 3D navigation controls (specify controls if known, e.g., Alt+Click, WASD, Mouse Wheel) to change your view.

Monitor: Keep an eye on the Status Bar for FPS and Object Count to gauge performance.

```

Prerequisites:

Install Visual Studio (Specify required version, e.g., 2019 or 2022) with the ".NET desktop development" workload.

Ensure the .NET Framework 4.8 SDK is installed.

(List any other specific dependencies that need manual installation)

Open the Solution: Launch Visual Studio and open the [YourSolutionName.sln] (<- Specify the SLN file name) file located in the repository's root directory.

Restore Dependencies: Visual Studio should automatically restore NuGet packages. If not, right-click the Solution in Solution Explorer and select "Restore NuGet Packages".

Build the Solution: Select Build > Build Solution from the main menu (or press Ctrl+Shift+B). Choose either Debug or Release configuration.

Run the Editor:

Press F5 within Visual Studio to start debugging.

Alternatively, navigate to the output folder (e.g., bin/Debug or bin/Release) and run the compiled [ExecutableName.exe] (<- Specify the EXE name) directly.
